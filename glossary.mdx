# Glossary

A comprehensive reference of terms used throughout Braid Protocol documentation.

---

## A

### Active Set
The collection of orders currently being considered by the matching engine during a swap. Limited to `MAX_ACTIVE_SET` (512) orders to ensure bounded compute.

### AMM (Automated Market Maker)
A smart contract that provides liquidity using a mathematical formula instead of discrete orders. Braid includes a CP-AMM alongside its orderbook.

### Ask
An order to sell the base token. Asks are priced in quote token per base token. The best ask is the lowest-priced sell order.

---

## B

### Base Token
The first token in a trading pair. In SOL/USDC, SOL is the base token. Amounts are expressed in base token units.

### Bid
An order to buy the base token. Bids are priced in quote token per base token. The best bid is the highest-priced buy order.

### Bips (Basis Points)
A unit equal to 1/100th of a percent (0.01%). Used for fee calculations. 100 bips = 1%.

---

## C

### CLMM (Concentrated Liquidity Market Maker)
An order type that provides liquidity within a specified price range. More capital-efficient than traditional AMMs. When filled, CLMM orders automatically "flip" to the opposite side.

### Compute Units (CU)
Solana's measure of computational resources. Transactions have a CU limit. Braid operations are designed to fit within typical limits (~200,000-400,000 CU).

### CP-AMM (Constant Product AMM)
The traditional x·y=k AMM included in Braid for baseline liquidity. Provides passive liquidity across all prices.

### Crank
An off-chain bot that performs maintenance operations like shard splitting, merging, and rebalancing. Anyone can run a crank.

---

## D

### Density Function
The mathematical function d(p) = k·t^n that describes how liquidity is distributed across a price range in an order curve. Higher density means more liquidity at that price.

### Dust
Very small order amounts that are economically insignificant. The matching engine can skip dust orders to save compute.

---

## E

### Equilibrium Price
The price at which total supply equals total demand in the matching engine. Found using Newton-Raphson optimization.

### Exponent (n)
The power in the order curve density function. Controls the shape of liquidity distribution:
- n=1: Uniform (flat)
- n=2: Concentrated at boundaries
- n>2: Highly concentrated

---

## F

### Fill
The execution of an order. A partial fill leaves remaining liquidity. A complete fill removes the order.

### Flip Mechanism
The process where filled CLMM liquidity moves to the opposite side. If you sell 10 SOL, that becomes buying power for ~$1,500 worth of SOL at lower prices.

### Front-Running
A form of MEV where a bot sees your pending transaction and places their own transaction first to profit from the price movement you'll cause.

---

## G

### GTC (Good-Till-Cancelled)
An order that remains active until filled or explicitly cancelled. Most limit orders are GTC.

### GTD (Good-Till-Date)
An order with an expiration timestamp. Automatically cancelled if not filled by the specified time.

---

## I

### Impermanent Loss (IL)
The opportunity cost of providing liquidity compared to simply holding the tokens. Called "impermanent" because it reverses if price returns to the entry point.

### Inverse Order
In CLMM, the paired order on the opposite side. Every CLMM order has a linked inverse that receives flipped liquidity.

---

## L

### Li-Chao Tree
A data structure for efficient "best price" queries across multiple orders. Not currently used in Braid but mentioned in the whitepaper.

### Limit Order
A simple order to buy or sell at a specific price. Fills if the market reaches your price.

### Liquidity
The amount of tokens available for trading. More liquidity = less slippage = better prices.

### LP (Liquidity Provider)
Someone who deposits tokens into the protocol to earn trading fees.

### LP Token
A token representing your share of a liquidity pool. Burning LP tokens withdraws your proportional share.

---

## M

### Maker
A trader who adds liquidity by placing orders that wait on the book. Makers typically pay lower fees.

### Marginal Price
The instantaneous price at the current fill level. As you fill more, the marginal price moves along the order curve.

### Market
A Solana account storing configuration for a trading pair. Contains fee settings, shard pointers, and CP-AMM reserves.

### Matching Engine
The core algorithm that finds optimal prices and fills orders. Uses Newton-Raphson optimization.

### MEV (Maximal Extractable Value)
Value extracted by reordering, inserting, or censoring transactions. Includes front-running, sandwich attacks, and JIT liquidity.

### Min Order Bips
A parameter that tells the matching engine to skip orders smaller than X% of the remaining swap. Prevents dust griefing.

### minOut
Minimum acceptable output amount. If the swap would produce less, the transaction reverts. Primary slippage protection.

---

## N

### Newton-Raphson
An iterative algorithm for finding roots of equations. Braid uses it to find the equilibrium price across multiple order curves in ~3 iterations.

---

## O

### Order Curve
Braid's core abstraction: a continuous function describing how liquidity is distributed across a price range. Unifies all order types under a single mathematical framework.

### Order ID
A unique identifier for an order, used for cancellation and tracking.

### Orderbook
The collection of all bids and asks for a market. In Braid, orderbooks are sharded across multiple accounts.

---

## P

### PDA (Program Derived Address)
A Solana account address deterministically derived from seeds. Braid uses PDAs for markets, shards, and user accounts.

### Price Impact
How much your trade moves the market price. Larger trades have larger price impact.

### Pro-Rata Matching
Filling multiple orders at the same price proportionally by their size, rather than first-in-first-out. Eliminates latency advantages.

### PropAMM
Slot-scoped orders with zero fees. Valid for only ~400ms, providing strong MEV protection.

### Protocol
The global Solana account storing protocol-wide settings like admin keys and default fee rates.

---

## Q

### Quote Token
The second token in a trading pair. In SOL/USDC, USDC is the quote token. Prices are expressed in quote per base.

---

## R

### Rebalance
A crank operation that moves orders between shards to maintain even distribution. Happens when shard sizes become unbalanced.

### Red-Black Tree
A self-balancing binary search tree used for efficient order storage and lookup. Braid embeds RB-trees in shard accounts.

### Reserve
The amount of tokens held in an AMM pool. The product of reserves (k) stays constant during swaps.

---

## S

### Sandwich Attack
An MEV attack where a bot trades before AND after your transaction, profiting from the price movement in between.

### Sequence Number
A counter on each order that prevents replay attacks. Only updates with higher sequence numbers are accepted.

### Shard
A Solana account containing a subset of orders within a price range. Shards form a linked list for efficient traversal.

### Shard Manager
The component in the Market account that tracks shard boundaries and orchestrates split/merge/rebalance operations.

### Side
The direction of a trade or order: Bid (buy base) or Ask (sell base).

### Size-Augmented Tree
An RB-tree where each node stores the maximum size in its subtree. Enables O(log n) lookup of the smallest order for eviction.

### Slippage
The difference between expected price and actual execution price. Caused by price movement between submission and execution.

### Slot
Solana's unit of time, approximately 400ms. PropAMM orders are valid for exactly one slot.

### Spot Price
The current instantaneous price, before any trade occurs. In CP-AMM, it's the ratio of reserves.

### Split
A crank operation that divides a shard into two when it exceeds capacity. Creates a new shard and redistributes orders.

---

## T

### Taker
A trader who removes liquidity by trading against existing orders. Takers typically pay higher fees.

### Tree Node
The metadata stored with each order for tree operations: parent, left, right pointers and color (red/black).

---

## V

### Vault
A token account owned by the market PDA that holds deposited tokens. Each market has vaults for both tokens.

---

## W

### Weighted Average
A method of calculating a representative value where each component contributes proportionally to its weight. Used for initial price guess in Newton-Raphson.
