# PropAMM Orders

Proportional AMM orders are slot-scoped, two-sided liquidity positions with **zero fees**, designed for **ultra-tight spreads** and high-fidelity trading.

## Overview

PropAMM orders enable the tightest spreads on Braid:

- **Zero trading fees**: No fee overhead means spreads can be tighter
- **Slot-scoped**: Valid only for the current slot (~400ms), reducing adverse selection risk
- **Two-sided**: Place bid AND ask simultaneously around a price range
- **High-fidelity execution**: Traders get prices very close to true market value

## Why Zero Fees?

The zero-fee design is the key to competitive spreads:

| Order Type | Fee | Spread Impact |
|------------|-----|---------------|
| CLMM | `clmm_fee_bps` (typically 30 bps) | Fee adds to effective spread |
| Limit | `limit_fee_bps` (typically 20 bps) | Fee adds to effective spread |
| **PropAMM** | **0 bps** | **Spread is pure bid-ask** |

With zero fees, a maker quoting 1bp wide is actually 1bp wide—not 1bp + 20-30bp in fees.

## Why Slot-Scoping?

Slot-scoping (~400ms validity) lets makers quote tighter because:

1. **Reduced adverse selection**: Less time for prices to move against you
2. **Lower inventory risk**: Short exposure window
3. **Confident pricing**: Quote based on current market conditions, not future uncertainty

This is the same reason traditional market makers quote tighter for immediate-or-cancel orders vs. resting orders.

## Place Order

PropAMM orders place liquidity on both sides of the orderbook:

```typescript
const ixs = await market.placePropOrder({
  pMin: 148_000_000n,           // Lower price bound
  pMax: 152_000_000n,           // Upper price bound
  maxBase: 5_000_000_000n,      // Max SOL to deposit
  maxQuote: 750_000_000_000n,   // Max USDC to deposit
  bidExponent: 0,               // Bid density (0=uniform, 1=linear, 2+=concentrated)
  askExponent: 0,               // Ask density
  sequenceNumber: 1,            // Unique per slot (for deduplication)
  owner: wallet,
});
```

This creates both a bid and ask within the price range, valid for the current slot only.

## Parameters

| Parameter | Type | Description |
|-----------|------|-------------|
| `pMin` | `bigint` | Lower price bound |
| `pMax` | `bigint` | Upper price bound |
| `maxBase` | `bigint` | Max base token (SOL) to deposit |
| `maxQuote` | `bigint` | Max quote token (USDC) to deposit |
| `bidExponent` | `number` | Bid density curve (0=uniform, 1=linear, 2+=concentrated) |
| `askExponent` | `number` | Ask density curve (0=uniform, 1=linear, 2+=concentrated) |
| `sequenceNumber` | `number` | Unique identifier per slot (for deduplication) |
| `owner` | `TransactionSigner` | Position owner (signer) |

## Use Cases

- **High-frequency market making**: Quote tight spreads with minimal risk
- **Programmatic trading**: Bots that need predictable, low-cost execution
- **Large trades**: Get competitive pricing without fee drag
- **Latency-sensitive strategies**: Price based on current conditions only

## Best Practices

For tightest execution:

1. **Submit via Jito bundles**: Ensures your order lands in the intended slot
2. **Quote around mid-market**: Center your pMin/pMax on the current price
3. **Use appropriate exponent**: Higher exponent = more liquidity concentrated at mid-price
4. **Monitor slot timing**: Submit early in the slot for best fill probability
