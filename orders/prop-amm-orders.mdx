# PropAMM Orders

Proportional AMM orders are slot-scoped, two-sided liquidity positions with **zero fees**, designed for MEV-resistant trading.

## Overview

PropAMM orders are:
- **Two-sided**: Place bid AND ask simultaneously around a price range
- Valid only for the current slot (~400ms)
- **Zero trading fees** (no base fee, no slot fee)
- Designed to discourage front-running through slot-scoping

## Zero Fee Design

Unlike CLMM and Limit orders which charge trading fees, PropAMM orders have **no fees**:

| Order Type | Fee |
|------------|-----|
| CLMM | `clmm_fee_bps` (typically 30 bps) |
| Limit | `limit_fee_bps` (typically 20 bps) |
| **PropAMM** | **0 bps (zero fees)** |

The zero-fee design compensates makers for the extremely short order lifetime (~1 slot).

## Place Order

PropAMM orders place liquidity on both sides of the orderbook:

```typescript
const tx = await market.placePropOrder({
  pMin: 148_000_000n,      // Lower price bound
  pMax: 152_000_000n,      // Upper price bound
  amount: 10_000_000_000n, // Liquidity amount
  owner: wallet.publicKey,
});
```

This creates both a bid and ask within the price range, valid for the current slot only.

## Parameters

| Parameter | Type | Description |
|-----------|------|-------------|
| `pMin` | `bigint` | Lower price bound |
| `pMax` | `bigint` | Upper price bound |
| `amount` | `bigint` | Total liquidity amount |
| `owner` | `PublicKey` | Position owner (signer) |

## MEV Protection

PropAMM orders protect against front-running because:

1. **Slot-scoped validity**: Orders expire after ~400ms, leaving no time for MEV bots to react
2. **Two-sided**: Provides liquidity on both sides, harder to exploit directionally
3. **Zero fees**: No fee advantage to extract
4. **Private submission**: Best used with Jito bundles to hide orders from mempool

## Use Cases

- MEV-resistant swaps
- Time-sensitive market making
- Large trades that would otherwise be sandwiched
- High-frequency two-sided liquidity
