# Concentrated Liquidity

Concentrated liquidity lets you provide liquidity in a specific price range instead of across all prices. This means your capital works harder - you earn more fees with less money.

## The Problem with Traditional AMMs

In a traditional AMM (like Uniswap v2), your liquidity is spread across all possible prices - from $0 to infinity:

```
Traditional AMM: Your $10,000 spread across ALL prices

$0 ──────────────────────────────────────────────── $∞
   [thin liquidity everywhere, most of it unused]
```

If SOL trades between $140-$160, the liquidity you have at $50 or $500 just sits there doing nothing.

## Concentrated Liquidity Solution

With concentrated liquidity, you choose exactly where to put your capital:

```
Concentrated: Your $10,000 focused on $140-$160

$0 ─────── $140 ████████████████████ $160 ─────── $∞
              [thick liquidity where trading happens]
```

Same $10,000, but now it's all working in the active trading range.

## Why This Matters

| | Traditional AMM | Concentrated |
|--|----------------|--------------|
| Your deposit | $10,000 | $10,000 |
| Liquidity in active range | ~$200 | $10,000 |
| **Capital efficiency** | **1x** | **~50x** |
| Fees earned (same volume) | $1 | ~$50 |

By concentrating your liquidity, you can earn **10-100x more fees** with the same capital.

## The Trade-off

More efficiency comes with more responsibility:

| Benefit | Trade-off |
|---------|-----------|
| Higher fee earnings | Must choose a good range |
| Better capital efficiency | Impermanent loss is amplified in-range |
| Customizable exposure | Need to monitor and adjust |

If price leaves your range, you stop earning fees until it returns (or you reposition).

## Quick Start

```typescript
// Provide liquidity between $145-$155
const ixs = await market.placeClmmPosition({
  ask: {
    pMin: 145_000_000n,       // Lower bound: $145
    pMax: 155_000_000n,       // Upper bound: $155
    amount: 10_000_000_000n,  // 10 SOL
    exponent: 0,              // Uniform distribution
  },
  owner: wallet,
});
```
