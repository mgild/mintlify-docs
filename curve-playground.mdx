# Density Curve Playground

Density curves are the mathematical heart of Braid. They define **how your liquidity is distributed across a price range**. This interactive playground lets you experiment with different curve shapes and see exactly where your capital will be deployed.

## Understanding the Visualization

### What You're Looking At

The chart shows your **liquidity density** (Y-axis) across a **price range** (X-axis):

| Element | Meaning |
|---------|---------|
| **White dashed line** (left edge) | Current spot price - where the market is now |
| **Blue filled area** | Your liquidity distribution across the range |
| **Gray dotted line** | Average execution price - where most of your order will fill |
| **X-axis** | Price range from spot (left) to upper bound (right) |
| **Y-axis** | Relative liquidity density at each price |

### The Controls

| Control | What It Does |
|---------|--------------|
| **Exponent** | Shape of the curve (-5 to +5). Controls where liquidity concentrates. |
| **Start Price** | Lower bound of your range (% from spot to upper) |
| **End Price** | Upper bound of your range (% from spot to upper) |

## How Exponent Shapes Your Curve

The exponent is the most important parameter. It determines whether your liquidity concentrates **near the current price** or **far from it**.

### Negative Exponent (e.g., -2.0)

**More liquidity near spot price, less at the edges.**

```
Density
  │
  █████
  ██████████
  ███████████████
  ████████████████████
  ──────────────────────────► Price
  Spot                    Upper
```

**Use cases:**
- **Conservative DCA**: Buy more at prices close to current, less as price falls further
- **Tight range LP**: Concentrate liquidity where most trading happens
- **Mean reversion**: Expect price to stay near current levels

### Zero Exponent (0.0)

**Uniform distribution - equal liquidity at every price.**

```
Density
  │
  ████████████████████████
  ████████████████████████
  ████████████████████████
  ████████████████████████
  ──────────────────────────► Price
  Spot                    Upper
```

**Use cases:**
- **Simple limit orders**: Traditional orderbook behavior
- **Uncertainty**: No strong view on where price will go
- **Baseline comparison**: Default behavior to compare against

### Positive Exponent (e.g., +2.0)

**Less liquidity near spot, more at the edges.**

```
Density
  │
                    █████
              ██████████
        ███████████████
  ████████████████████
  ──────────────────────────► Price
  Spot                    Upper
```

**Use cases:**
- **Aggressive DCA**: Buy small amounts early, load up if price drops significantly
- **Breakout trading**: Capture large moves while minimizing exposure to chop
- **Tail risk**: Position for extreme scenarios

## Real-World Examples

### Example 1: Graduated Buy Order

*"I want to accumulate SOL, buying more aggressively as the price drops."*

**Settings:**
- Exponent: **+1.5** (more liquidity at lower prices)
- Start Price: **0%** (start buying immediately below spot)
- End Price: **100%** (full range to your lower bound)

**Result:** You'll buy a little SOL if it dips 5%, moderate amounts at 10-15% down, and the bulk of your order fills if it drops 20%+.

### Example 2: Tight Range Market Making

*"I want to provide liquidity in a narrow band around the current price."*

**Settings:**
- Exponent: **-1.0** (concentrate near current price)
- Start Price: **40%** (start 40% into your range)
- End Price: **60%** (end 60% into your range)

**Result:** Your liquidity is concentrated in the middle 20% of your total range, maximizing fee capture where most trades occur.

### Example 3: Breakout Seller

*"I want to sell into strength, selling more as price rises further."*

**Settings:**
- Exponent: **+2.0** (more liquidity at extreme prices)
- Start Price: **0%** (start selling just above spot)
- End Price: **100%** (sell through entire upper range)

**Result:** Small sells on initial price increases, but if price really pumps, you're selling significant size into the euphoria.

### Example 4: Traditional Limit Order

*"I just want to buy at exactly $145, like a normal limit order."*

**Settings:**
- Exponent: **0** (doesn't matter for point orders)
- Start Price: **50%** (your target price)
- End Price: **50%** (same as start = single price point)

**Result:** The curve collapses to a vertical line - all liquidity at one price, just like a traditional limit order.

## The Math Behind the Curve

For the mathematically curious, density curves follow a power-law formula:

```
d(t) = k · t^(2^|n|)

Where:
  t = normalized position in range [0, 1]
  n = exponent from the slider
  k = normalization constant (ensures total = 1)
```

### How Exponent Transforms the Curve

| Exponent | Power | Behavior |
|----------|-------|----------|
| -3.0 | t^8 inverted | Extremely front-loaded |
| -2.0 | t^4 inverted | Heavily front-loaded |
| -1.0 | t^2 inverted | Moderately front-loaded |
| 0.0 | flat | Uniform distribution |
| +1.0 | t^2 | Moderately back-loaded |
| +2.0 | t^4 | Heavily back-loaded |
| +3.0 | t^8 | Extremely back-loaded |

The curve smoothly blends toward uniform (flat) as the exponent approaches zero.

  <Card title="Start with Your Thesis" icon="lightbulb">
    What's your market view? Mean reversion → negative exponent. Trend following → positive exponent. Uncertain → zero.
  </Card>
  <Card title="Watch the Average Line" icon="chart-line">
    The gray dotted line shows your expected average fill price. Make sure it matches your expectations.
  </Card>
  <Card title="Narrower = More Concentrated" icon="compress">
    Reducing the range (Start/End closer together) concentrates your liquidity, similar to increasing exponent magnitude.
  </Card>
  <Card title="Combine with Range" icon="sliders">
    Use both exponent AND range to fine-tune. A moderate exponent with a narrow range can achieve similar results to an extreme exponent with a wide range.

## From Playground to Code

Once you've found a curve shape you like, translate it to code:

<Tabs>
  <Tab title="TypeScript">
```typescript
// Example: Graduated buy with positive exponent
const ix = await market.placeLimitOrder({
  side: 'bid',
  pMin: 130_000_000n,    // Lower bound: $130
  pMax: 150_000_000n,    // Upper bound: $150 (spot)
  amount: 5000_000_000n, // 5000 USDC to deploy
  exponent: 1.5,         // More liquidity at lower prices
  owner: wallet,
});

// Example: Tight range LP with negative exponent
const clmmIx = await market.placeClmmPosition({
  pMin: 145_000_000n,    // $145
  pMax: 155_000_000n,    // $155
  maxBase: 10_000_000_000n,
  maxQuote: 1_500_000_000n,
  exponent: -1.0,        // Concentrate near middle of range
  owner: wallet,
});
```
  </Tab>
  <Tab title="Rust">
```rust
// Example: Graduated buy with positive exponent
let ix = market.place_limit_order(PlaceLimitOrderParams {
    side: Side::Bid,
    p_min: 130_000_000,    // $130
    p_max: 150_000_000,    // $150
    amount: 5_000_000_000, // 5000 USDC
    exponent: 15,          // 1.5 (scaled by 10)
})?;
```
  </Tab>
</Tabs>

<Note>
**Exponent scaling**: In the SDK, exponents may be scaled (e.g., 1.5 → 15). Check the SDK documentation for your specific version's conventions.
</Note>
