# Orderbook Accounts

Orderbook data is stored in shard accounts, one per order type.

## ClmmOrders (Shard)

```
Seeds: ["clmm_orders", market, shard_idx]
```

Contains CLMM orders within a price range.

## LimitOrders (Shard)

```
Seeds: ["limit_orders", market, shard_idx]
```

Contains limit orders within a price range.

## PropAmmOrders

```
Seeds: ["prop_amm_orders", market]
```

Non-sharded account for PropAMM orders.

## Shard Header

All shard types share a common header structure:

```rust
struct BaseShardHeader {
    discriminator: [u8; 8],
    self_pubkey: Address,
    market: Address,
    market_id: u64,
    bids: SideState,
    asks: SideState,
    capacity: u32,
    last_updated_at: i64,
    next_order_id: u64,
    next_bids_shard: Address,     // Toward lower prices (worse bids)
    next_asks_shard: Address,     // Toward higher prices (worse asks)
    next_bids_shard_idx: u64,
    next_asks_shard_idx: u64,
    shard_idx: u64,
    min_price: u64,
    max_price: u64,
    shard_flags: u8,
    bump: u8,
    migration_direction: u8,
    pending_migration: u32,
}
```
