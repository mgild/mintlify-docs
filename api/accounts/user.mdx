# User Accounts

## User

Global per-user account tracking order capacity.

```
Seeds: ["user", owner]
```

```rust
struct User {
    discriminator: [u8; 8],
    owner: Address,
    max_orders: u32,
    current_orders: u32,
}
```

## UserOrdersHeader

Per-user per-market order tracking.

```
Seeds: ["user_orders_header", owner, market]
```

```rust
struct UserOrdersHeader {
    discriminator: [u8; 8],
    owner: Address,
    market: Address,
    order_count: u32,
    pending_evictions: u32,
}
```

### Automatic Eviction

When placing new PropAMM orders, any expired slot-scoped orders are automatically evicted and their funds returned. This happens transparently during the place instruction - no separate claim step is needed.
